# Zephyr SIG
English | [简体中文](./sig-zephyr_cn.md)

Founded by Intel, Synopsys, NXP etc. in 2016, the [Zephyr Project](https://www.zephyrproject.org) is a Linux Foundation hosted Collaboration Project. It’s an open source collaborative effort uniting developers and users in building a best-in-class small, scalable, real-time operating system (RTOS) optimized for resource-constrained devices, across multiple architectures.

Zephyr SIG(Special Interest Group) is devoted to be a bridge to connect OpenEuler community and Zephyr community, one hand to contribute the
promotion and localization of Zephyr in China, on the other hand to bring Zephyr in to enlarge openEuler's ecosystem. There is great cooperation
space between Zephyr's IoT OS/RTOS technology and openEuler's Linux technology.

## SIG Mission and Scope

### Mission

- Promotion and introduction of Zephyr Project in China, let more people know and use Zephyr
- As a bridge to connect Zephyr community and OpenEuler community to contribute the localization of
  Zephyr through OpenEuler, and the internationalization of openEuler through Zephyr

### Scope

- create and maintain the mirror of Zephyr latest release and LTS release
- share the experience and make the discussion about Zephyr in Chinese
- translate and create the docs about Zephyr, include but not limited to Zephyr user manual, Blogs
- organize the periodic on-line meeting for Chinese developers and users
- join in or provide help to the related events organized by Zephyr community or openEuler community
- demos with openEuler Linux and Zephyr
- cooperation with other SIGs, e.g., SIG-Yocto, SIG-Industry, SIG-embedded

### Deliverables

- Zephyr release mirror: https://gitee.com/src-openeuler/zephyr
- Zephyr demos and Chinese docs: https://gitee.com/openeuler/zephyr-cn
- Zephyr based embedded hypervisor: https://gitee.com/openeuler/zvm
