description: Key features of i3 are good documentation, reasonable defaults (changeable in a simple configuration file) and good multi-monitor support. The user interface is designed for power users and emphasizes keyboard usage. i3 uses XCB for asynchronous communication with X11 and aims to be fast and light-weight.
