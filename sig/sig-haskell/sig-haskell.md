# Application to create a new SIG
English | [简体中文](./sig-haskell_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

Haskell is a functional, static typed, lazy programming language. Haskell is already a widely used programming language, and there're a lot of widely used software components written in Haskell.

This SIG focus on porting Haskell compiler and software written in Haskell to openEuler ecosystem.

Because ghc, a typical haskell compiler, is self-bootstraping. This SIG also plans to investigate and implement an generic bootstrap process for openEuler, and also maintaine the related oEEP documentation.

Haskell SIG expect to release Haskell tools and software components in future openEuler releases. So support and collabration from release management and security SIGs are needed.

### Deliverables

We are going to deliver rpm spec files for Haskell components.

### Repositories and description managed by this SIG

Haskell SIG manages the GHC compiler, and other software components. Typical software in Haskell will be managed by this SIG,  pandoc for example.

### Cross-domain and external-oriented processes
