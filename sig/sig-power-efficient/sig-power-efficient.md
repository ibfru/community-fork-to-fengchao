# Application to create a new SIG
English | [简体中文](./sig-template_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

- The power consumption of computing centers accounts for an increasing proportion of national power consumption, and the power cost of enterprise data centers accounts for an increasing proportion of enterprise operation costs. With the global promotion of green energy and carbon emission reduction, the industry has shifted from simply pursuing server performance indicators to pursuing energy efficiency indicators.

- This SIG is dedicated to improving server energy efficiency through OS tuning. Current main work:
  - Provides unified power APIs for the application layer for energy efficiency management.
  - Provides node-level automatic adjustment, including energy efficiency-based CPU frequency adjustment, CPU core isolation, and disk/NIC energy efficiency management.
