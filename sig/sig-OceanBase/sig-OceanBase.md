
# Application to create a new SIG
English | [简体中文](./sig-OceanBase_cn.md)

OceanBase Database is a distributed relational database. It is developed entirely by Ant Group. The OceanBase Database is built on a common server cluster. Based on the Paxos protocol and its distributed structure, the OceanBase Database provides high availability and linear scalability. The OceanBase Database is not dependent on specific hardware architectures.

On June 1, 2021, OceanBase was officially open-sourced, including server, client, toolchains, dependency libraries, etc. Additionally, support is provided for open source enthusiasts to participate in the OceanBase project.

Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

 ### Mission

 - Support building, deploying and developing OceanBase on openEuler

 - To advance Collaboration of the basic software such as server, client, toolchains and dependency libraries, in sync with the LTS version of the openEuler

 - Attract support from other upstream and downstream tools around OceanBase to build a complete and robust OceanBase database ecosystem.

 ### Scope
 
 - Submit server, client, toolchains and dependency libraries building source code to openEuler community
 
 - Coordinate the DB and other ecological chains to participate in openEuler

 ### Deliverables

 - Source code

 - repo, images

 - Documentation
 

 ### Repositories and description managed by this SIG
 
 - Source code
  - [OceanBase](https://gitee.com/src-openeuler/oceanbase/tree/master): OceanBase LTS source code and building code.

 ### Cross-domain and external-oriented processes

 Cross-domain and externally-oriented processes and actions defined and implemented by this SIG:

 - Non-Internal Process Checklist

 - The organization guidance plan for the entire openEulerSIG owned by this SIG, etc.
