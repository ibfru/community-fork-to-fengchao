# Application to create a new SIG
English | [简体中文](./sig-template_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

Describe the Mission and objectives of the new SIG, including but not limited to:

- Why create a new SIG in openEuler
 1. Provide message middleware software solutions for industry open-source users (including tools for Euler system adaptation, migration, and optimization);
 2. Exploring acceleration solutions for message middleware based on Euler community basic software;
 3. Exploring the New Direction of Message Middleware software;

- The scope of the SIG
 1. Maintain messaging middleware software packages for upstream open source communities (such as Apache RocketMQ);
 2. Incubate the new open source self-developed message middleware in the OpenEuler community （such as, Mobile Cloud, Huawei Cloud, JD Cloud, and Tencent Cloud);
 3. Regularly organize online meetings and technical meetup for message middleware technical topics;
 4. Provide the industricalmessage middleware solutions based on OpenEuler systems and basic softwares;
 5. Exploring an acceleration solution for message middleware based on OpenEuler Systems;

- Which SIGs in openEuler to coorperate with
 1. High performance network sig;
 2. Euler kernel sig;
 3. CloudNative sig;
