
# Application to create a new SIG
English | [简体中文](./sig-intelligence_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

Describe the Mission and objectives of the new SIG, including but not limited to:

- Why create a new SIG in openEuler
  - Vision: To integrate intelligent operating systems, accelerate the promotion and application exploration of AI technologies.
- The scope of the SIG
  - Engineering capabilities and toolchains for data/embedding, API integration, and model fine-tuning
  - Large Model Application Incubation: Foster projects like SparkDesk and EulerCopilot.
  - AI Intelligent Agents: Leveraging function call capabilities and workflows of AI agents (such as autogen, metagpt, Langchain, etc.), to establish capabilities ranging from knowledge Q&A, single transaction processing to complex task orchestration within the OS domain. This supports the intelligent upgrade of not only operating systems but also applications.
- Which SIGs in openEuler to coorperate with 
  - A-Tune, ai，sig-ops, etc


### Deliverables

What and in what form the SIG is responsible for delivering
 
- Source code

- tar

- Source and tar
 

### Repositories and description managed by this SIG


### Cross-domain and external-oriented processes

Cross-domain and externally-oriented processes and actions defined and implemented by this SIG:
